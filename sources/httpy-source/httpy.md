# Httpy
This one is a bit more complex. It is made more like a real command than an alias. It launches "python3 -m http.server".   
By default the previous command launches a basic http server on standard interface that allow quick file sharing (maybe other things but this is my main use case). The default port for the server is 8000 but with the "-p" flag you can specify the port on which it should listen.   
You have bultin --help/-h  and --version/-v to get some intel on how to use the command.   
No it doesn't come with a man page, I don't know and want to do this...yet.
