# Bash-aliases
Just a bunch of compiled commands to use in Bash.

## Why ?
I made theses aliases to ease the use of Windows and Linux CLI, especially when usin [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install).

### For who ?
Me, but anyone who wish to be able to pull theses aliases anywhere can !
